// `realm.cpp` was 1514 lines. It is four files now -- the spine (raising, the tick, accept,
// press, step), the items and the trade, the moving and the thinking, and the fighting -- all
// implementing the one `Realm` declared in `realm.h`. This was its anonymous namespace, and it
// had to become something all four can see.
//
// It is a better place for them than the top of one .cpp. docs/conventions.md's rule for this
// layer is that "every constant is traced to OpenMU's Version075, MuMain's own C++ or mu.db,
// with the source named in a comment, and a departure is marked `invention` on the line that
// makes it" -- and a reader checking that rule now has one page to read rather than a file to
// scroll. The comments below are the originals, unchanged.
